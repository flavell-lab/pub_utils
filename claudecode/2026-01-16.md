# Claude Code Session Log - 2026-01-16

## Session Checkpoint - 2026-01-16

### Changes Made

1. **README.md Assets Tree Audit**
   - Identified misalignment: `connectomes/candy_assembly/` listed in README but deleted from filesystem
   - `connectomes/preassembled/structural/` and `connectomes/preassembled/molecular/` exist and are aligned

2. **notebook/plot_neuron_features.ipynb** - Updated cells to:
   - Cell 1: Reorder rows to `pu.AllHermNeurons` order before creating NeuronFeatures
   - Cell 1: Save output as CSV (`../connectomes/neuron_features.csv`) instead of pickle
   - Cell 2: Load from CSV instead of pickle, removed `import pickle`

3. **src/pub_utils/core.py** - Fixed NeuronFeatures class:
   - Removed `self.neuron_ids.sort()` (line 52)
   - Changed `heatmap_data.sort_index()` to `heatmap_data.loc[self.neuron_ids]`
   - Now preserves input DataFrame row order instead of forcing alphabetical sort

### Files Modified
- `notebook/plot_neuron_features.ipynb`
- `src/pub_utils/core.py`

### Build Status
- Not tested yet - changes ready for notebook execution

### Open Items
- README.md `candy_assembly/` section needs update (either restore files or remove from docs)
