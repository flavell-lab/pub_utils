description: Activates high-efficiency mode to save tokens and avoid limits.
---

You are now in **Budget Mode**. To save tokens and stay within usage limits, follow these rules strictly for the remainder of this session:

1. **Be Concise:** Provide only necessary code changes. Skip long explanations unless I specifically ask for them.
2. **Use Diffs:** Never rewrite an entire file. Only show the specific lines that changed using diff blocks.
3. **No Small Talk:** Do not apologize or provide conversational filler.
4. **Context Control:** Before performing a task, check if there are any files currently in context that are NOT needed for this specific task. If so, suggest I remove them.

**Budget Mode Activated.** How can I help you efficiently?
